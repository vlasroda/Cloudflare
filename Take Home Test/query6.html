            <h2>Q6. Redirection based on user agent</h2>
            <h3>I want to redirect visitor with specific user agent (*MSIE 8.0* for example) to a different page.
                <br/>It seems this is not possible with Cloudflare Page Rules.
                <br/>Is there any other way to achieve that using Cloudflare?</h3>
            <pre class="answer">
                Thank you for your inquiry regarding redirecting visitors with a specific user agent to a different page. As a member of the Cloudflare Customer Support Team, I'll do my best to provide you with a solution or alternative approaches.

                Thought Process:
                <ol>
                    <li>Cloudflare's Page Rules do not currently support redirecting visitors based on their user agent string.
                    <li>However, Cloudflare offers other features that can potentially achieve this functionality, such as Cloudflare Workers or the Cloudflare Apps platform.
                    <li>Cloudflare Workers is a serverless execution environment that allows to run JavaScript code at the edge of Cloudflare's network, enabling the modification of incoming requests and responses, including the ability to inspect user agent strings and perform redirects.
                    <li>Alternatively, we could consider third-party applications or services available on the Cloudflare Apps platform that might offer user agent-based redirection capabilities.
                </ol>
                Tools I would use:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloudflare Workers documentation: To review the capabilities and examples for inspecting user agent strings and performing redirects using Cloudflare Workers.
                    <li>Cloudflare Apps platform: To search for and evaluate any third-party applications or services that offer user agent-based redirection functionality.
                </ul>
                After reviewing the relevant information, I would provide the customer with the following response:

                You're correct that Cloudflare's Page Rules do not currently support redirecting visitors based on their user agent string. However, there are alternative approaches you can consider using Cloudflare's other features.

                One option is to leverage Cloudflare Workers, which is a serverless execution environment that allows you to run JavaScript code at the edge of Cloudflare's network. With Cloudflare Workers, you can inspect incoming requests, including the user agent string, and perform redirects based on specific conditions.

                Another alternative is to explore third-party applications or services available on the Cloudflare Apps platform. Some of these apps might offer user agent-based redirection capabilities out of the box, potentially providing a more straightforward solution if Cloudflare Workers seem too complex for your use case.

                If you would like me to provide more detailed guidance on implementing a Cloudflare Worker for user agent-based redirection or assistance in finding a suitable third-party application, please let me know. I'd be happy to assist you further with this requirement.

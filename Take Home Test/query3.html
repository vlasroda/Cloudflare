            <h2>Q3. Workers not applied</h2>
            <h3>I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website: it works in the debugger but doesn't work when I
                query the site.
                <br/>Why is that? Is there anything to activate or anything I could check?</h3>
            <pre class="answer">
                Thank you for informing me about the issue you're facing with the Worker you've added to your Cloudflare Dashboard. As a member of the Cloudflare Customer Support Team, I'll do my best to assist you in resolving this problem.

                Thought Process:
                <ol>
                    <li>Cloudflare Workers are deployed globally across Cloudflare's network, but they may not be immediately active or accessible until certain settings are configured.
                    <li>There could be several reasons why the Worker is working in the debugger but not when querying the site, such as routing rules, Worker settings, or deployment status.
                    <li>To troubleshoot this issue, I would need to review the Worker's configuration, routing settings, and deployment status within the Cloudflare Dashboard.
                </ol>
                Tools I would use:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloudflare Dashboard: To review the Worker's code, configuration, and deployment status.
                    <li>Cloudflare Workers documentation: To cross-check the necessary settings and best practices for deploying and activating Workers.
                    <li>Command-line tools (e.g., curl, wget): To test the Worker's functionality directly from different locations and networks.
                </ul>
                After reviewing the relevant information, I would provide the customer with the following response:
            </pre>
            <pre class="answer">
                Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. It's not uncommon for Workers to work correctly in the debugger but fail to function as expected when querying the site. This could be due to various reasons, such as routing rules, Worker settings, or deployment status.

                To investigate further, I would need to review the Worker's configuration and deployment status within your Cloudflare Dashboard. Could you please provide me with the following information?
                <ol>
                    <li>The name or ID of the Worker you've added to your Cloudflare account.
                    <li>A screenshot or copy of the Worker's code and configuration settings.
                    <li>Confirmation that the Worker has been successfully deployed and is listed as "Active" in the Cloudflare Dashboard.
                </ol>
                Additionally, please let me know if you've configured any specific routing rules or settings for the Worker within the Cloudflare Dashboard.
                
                Once I have this information, I can cross-check the Worker's configuration against our recommended best practices and deployment guidelines. This will help me identify any potential issues or missing steps that might be causing the Worker to not function as expected when querying your site.

                Please feel free to share any additional details or observations you may have regarding this issue, and I'll be happy to assist you further in resolving it.
